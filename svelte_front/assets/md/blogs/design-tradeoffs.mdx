# Common Software Design Considerations

Software Design is all about tradeoffs.
There are some common axes along which we must decide where to sit.

## Time and Space

Most of the time, we think about the speed of a program. Faster is better. But this is often at the cost of memory space.

One of the easiest ways to speed up a program is a technique called memoization.
Memoization is basically the idea that we can save our work to avoid re-calculating things.

To speed up finding what webpages to display when searching 'brownie recipie' Google stores a keyword index.
To speed up a webserver we can cache the public pages on edge servers.
To speed up routing, a map can pre-calculate common paths.

Bubblesort is O(n^2) so it's slow for large inputs. However, it is O(1) in space, which contributes to it's low constant factor. For small inputs it can be the fastest algorithm. Heapsort has a high constant factor, so while it might not be the fastest algorithm for 10 elements, it will be much faster for a million.

## Latency and Throughput

Similarly, throughput gains often cost latency concesions.
A service might use a load balancer to distribute user requests among a number of servers, but calculating which server to send each request to (especially if it needs to be consistent) adds to the latency.
A database might need to have multiple shards to support all of the concurrent users, but when a user wants to know data about other people it takes more time to query the other shards.
Like finding a book in your backpack is fast, but you can't store many books. It takes a bit longer to find one at the library, but they can store more.
