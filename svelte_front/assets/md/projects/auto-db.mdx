# Todo

- [x] Install ERD and generate the Auth, Blog, and Comment tables diagram
- [ ] make a plugin to automatically parse ERD code blocks in MD to diagrams
- [ ] Make a parser for ERD that creates or verifies an existing DB schema

# What the heck?

While designing the data tables for the various features of this blog, I was writing a kind of loose list of entities, attributes, and relationships. Since I have images for all my blog articles, I thought about making a diagram in excalidraw or something, but in the spirit of DRY coding, I looked into ways to generate the tables.

## Considered Options

I found a few ideas. As I've mentioned in my [blog stack](/blog/articles/blog-stack) article, there are mdx extensions call remark and rehype plugins that will parse markdown. I found one that parses Mermaid diagram definitions and one that does PlantUML, among others. I also thought about using [Kroki](https://github.com/yuzutech/kroki), but running multiple containers just to make some diagrams seems like a bit much.

## ERD

The solution I ended up on was to use [ERD](https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd). It just takes text input and outputs an image. It doesn't automatically hook into my markdown pipeline, but it's a great solution with an easy cli so it should be easy to automate. I'm even thinking of creating my own remark plugin with ERD as a backend.

# SQL Schema generation

Since the ERD syntax is a pretty good subset of SQL, I figured it wouldn't be that hard to make a parser that can output SQL statements to create the tables depicted in the diagram. Things get a bit more complicated once the DB is already running, as I'll need to have some sort of versioning to be able to generate the migrations correctly. That would be a good way to document version history though.
Anyways, I figured it would be fun even if it's not _super_ useful.

## First run at making a parser

I started off asking Bard.Google to write the parser for me, using these prompts.

```
Can you write an algorithm to parse this ERD language and produce a full SQL table schema? a field named id should always have PRIMARY KEY autoincrement.
eg.
[Users]
*id {label: "int"}
username {label: "string"}
password_hash {label: "varchar"}
ip_fingerprint {label: "varchar"}
email {label: "varchar"}
post_notif {label: "bool"}
comment_notif {label: "bool"}

Should produce:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
    username varchar(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    ip_fingerprint varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    post_notif BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    comment_notif BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
);

...
can you make the python version callable from cli and have it take the .er file as a cli argument please?
...
there aren't always both a dataype and constraint, can we make them optional?
```

We landed on this code which is almost correct.

```python: erd_to_sql.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
