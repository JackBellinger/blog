### Why not use an off-the-shelf keyboard?
Mainly, I just wanted to make a keyboard. I had a mechanical keyboard from Amazon for years that typed well, but it was too clicky. I also wanted to program some macros and RGB effects.

## Build goals
My goals for this keyboard were to make something quiet, smooth typing, and compact.
I also wanted something beginner friendly that works with QMK/VIA so that I could get it assembled and running without too much work and leave myself room to add functionality later.

### Group buy
I joined the wuque studios ikki68 aurora group buy, and recieved it a year later. My gmk keycaps took even longer to arrive ðŸ˜….
I got the switches pretty easily, and I pulled the keycaps off my old board to use until my new set arrived.

### Switches
I went with Boba linear switches, and I really enjoy the sounds they make. hello I am Jack and My name is Jack and I am a software engineer and I like to write blogs and code and make cool stuff for you to use. I hope you like reading this blog and using my software. I can type pretty fast but it's hard to think of things to say so fastly. I can type type type type faster than I can think sometimes, but if I'm copying or writing something I already know what to type then I guess I'm limited by my typing skills. I can type words fast but when I'm writing code it's a bit harder to find the `\{\}` and \(\) keys and numbers and + - ~ and that sort of stuff. I guess it's kind of precise so it's good not to rush and make mistakes because it would be hard to catch a spelling error. The difference between stuff can be tricky to spot.

## Features
After I had been using the keyboard for a while, I decided to try out some of the more advanced features.
I've found a few of the many advanced features to be super useful: macros, tap-dance, and combos. Fiddling with the RGB underglow has been fun as well.
I added some code snippets to explain how things work, but you can find the source code in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jackbellinger/dotfiles/ikki68_aurora)

### Macros
You can read the full implementation of my macros in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/JackBellinger/dotfiles/blob/master/ikki68_aurora/keymaps/ikki_km/features/macro.c)
Check out my [macros](https://jackbellinger.github.io/blog/articles/qmk-macros) blog article for a full explanation of my macros.
### Tap Dance
You can read the full implementation of my tapdances in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/JackBellinger/dotfiles/blob/master/ikki68_aurora/keymaps/ikki_km/features/tapdance.c)
Check out my [macros](https://jackbellinger.github.io/blog/articles/qmk-tapdances) blog article for a full explanation of my tap dances.
### Combos
I haven't added any combos yet, but here's my ideas:
backspace + ` = backspace, for fatfingering
backspace + the macro button on the other side of backspace = backspace, for fatfingering
' + enter = enter, for fatfingering
a + c = ctrl + a, ctrl + c, for all-copy

### RBG Underglow
RGB ideas:
timer, stopwatch
layer indication
minigame
typing reactive
